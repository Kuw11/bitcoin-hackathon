Project NoRiskWallet
====================

The problem
-----------

- As a user I want to buy a movie and start watching it immediately
- As a mechant I want to sell a movie and receive the payment instantly without trusting any third party or any risk of charge back or double spend


Current solutions
-----------------

- Bitcoin payments can not be trusted unteil they receive at least 1 confirmation in the blockchain (10 mins on average).
- Paypal and credit cards can always do charge back from the customer and revoke the payment, even weeks after the transaction took place.


NoRiskWallet solutions
----------------------

With NoRiskWallet you can fund a risk free wallet and all the money that you don't spend after a deadline you set some time in the future, will return to you.

Now merchants can establish zera trust relations with NoRiskWallet to accept 0 confirmation transactions

You can pay any merchant that has a NoRiskWallet instantly and with no risk.


Extras
------

- NoRiskWallet has to put a collateral with the merchants that is at least as big as the funding users have in their NoRiskWallet
